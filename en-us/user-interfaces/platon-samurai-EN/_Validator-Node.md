## How to improve consensus probability

PlatON ranks the top 100 nodes as candidate nodes, and ranks the top 101-200 nodes as standby nodes, and the nodes beyond 200 will be removed from block producers list, sorted by voting tickets and staking amount.
The more staking amount, the higher the ranking, and results higher probability to become consensus node. So to increase the staking amounts of stake, can improve the probability effectively.

1.On the [My Producer] page, click [Increase Stake], as shown below:

## Why are block producer eliminated

As described before, PlatON ranks the top 100 nodes as candidate nodes, and ranks the top 101-200 nodes as standby nodes, and the nodes beyond 200 will be removed from block producers list, sorted by voting tickets and staking amount. So, when a new node with enough staking and voting tickets appears within top 200 ranking, the current 200th block producers will be replaced, and the voting tickets associated will be released as well.

The more staking amount, the higher the ranking, and results higher probability to become consensus node. So to increase the staking amounts of stake, can improve the probability effectively.
